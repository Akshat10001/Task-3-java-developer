This project is a simple Library Management System built using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles. It allows users to add books, register library members, issue books, return books, and view available books. The system is entirely console-based and is intended as a mini project for learning core Java concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and basic interaction using the terminal. It is developed using Java in Visual Studio Code and can be compiled and executed via the terminal.
